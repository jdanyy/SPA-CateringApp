# Single-page webapplication

- Welcome to Catering App! This is a Single Page webapplication written in **React**, using **Typescript**, developed as part of my 5'th semester SPA course at Babes Bolyai University. It serves as a frontend for a Restaurant, but is tightly integrated with Java Spring backend server. [See Github repo](https://github.com/jdanyy/cateringApp-javaSpring-backend)

- [See help section for testing with backend](<https://github.com/jdanyy/SPA-CateringApp/edit/main/README.md#Testing with backend>)

## Features

- The applicationp provides a **user friendly** interface.
- It is integrated with my Java Spring backend, so also provides an **authentication** possibility, with different user roles.(CLIENT, CHEF, ADMIN)
- There is also **theming** and **internationalization** in project which is syncronized with the user account.
